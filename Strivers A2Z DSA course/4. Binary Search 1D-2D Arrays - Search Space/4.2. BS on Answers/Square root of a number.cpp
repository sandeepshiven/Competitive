/*

Given an integer x, find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).

 

Example 1:

Input:
x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect 
square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
Example 2:

Input:
x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect 
square, so its square root is 2.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function floorSqrt() which takes x as the input parameter and return its square root.
Note: Try Solving the question without using the sqrt function. The value of x>=0.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
